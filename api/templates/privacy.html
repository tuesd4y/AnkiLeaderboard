	<h1>Privacy Policy of Anki Leaderboard</h1>

	<p>Anki Leaderboard operates the ankileaderboard.pythonanywhere.com website and the Anki Leaderboard add-on, which provides the SERVICE.</p>

	<p>This page is used to inform website visitors and add-on users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>

	<p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy. The Personal Information that we collect are used for providing the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy was created with the help of the <a href="https://www.privacypolicytemplate.net">Privacy Policy Template Generator</a>.</p>

	<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

	<p>For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including your username, email address and password. The information that we collect will be used to identify you. The add-on also collects your Anki stats (see below for more information). We don’t share your Personal Information with any third-parties.</p>

	<h3>Anki Stats</h3>
	<p>Every time you use the add-on, the following Anki stats will be sent to the server: How many cards you reviewed on that day, how many minutes you studied on that day, your streak (days studied in a row) on that day, how many cards you reviewed in the past 31 days, your retention on that day, how many cards you studied during the current season, how many minutes you studied during the current season, your retention during the current season and how many days you studied during the current season. The regular leaderboard stats will be overwritten every time you sync. Your league stats for the current season will be updated during the season, and will be overwritten when the new season begins. Only your XP (calculated based on your stats) will be saved after the season ended. Groups you joined will be saved until you leave them. The country you picked will be overwritten when you change it (picking a country is optional). If you create a new group, your username will be saved as the admin of that group. Everyone using our Service can see your Anki stats.</p>

	<h2>Deleting Personal Information</h2>
	<p>You can delete your Personal Information anytime by deleting your account.</p>
