# Leaderboard for Anki 2.1

This add-on ranks all of its users by the number of cards reviewed today, time spend studying today, current streak, reviews in the past 31 days and retention. You can also invite friends, join a group and/or country leaderboard and compete in leagues.

The online version of the add-on is available on [this website](https://ankileaderboard.pythonanywhere.com/).

## Installing
You can download the newest stable release from [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/41708974).

The newest stable version can also be downloaded from GitHub. Just download the .ankiaddon file from releases and open it.

If you want to test the newest, potentially unstable version from GitHub, clone this repository into the addons21 folder and run /tools/build_ui.sh. If you already have an account, you might want to copy the meta.json file into the cloned folder.
